# Ecommerce duplicates detection


Finding near-duplicates in large datasets is an important problem for many online businesses. 
Millions of product listings are created daily on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Shopee or eBay. 
Then, the challenge for online shops is to identify similar products despite having completely different images or descriptions. 
Finding resembling products allows e-commerce platforms to recommend customers better postings and help them find a better deal, increasing the chances of purchasing and facilitating the listing process for retailers. 
This project aims to implement a solution for duplicate products detection exploring multiple approaches based on image and text embeddings and analysing their performance.
